# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy ("policy") will help you understand how we use and protect the
data you provide to us when you use Copy To Wix Chrome Extension ("extension").

We reserve the right to change this policy at any given time, of which you will be promptly updated. If you want to
make sure that you are up to date with the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page.

### What user data we collect

We collect only the data that is clearly stated as a primary purpose for this extension.

When you click 'Copy' in the extension popup, we collect selected site contents and store it locally for the sole
purpose of being able to paste this contents into a Wix Site of your choice. Once you copied the contents, you can
open a Wix Site and click 'paste' in the extension popup.

### Remote Requests

There is only one remote request that this extension executes, and it is only to provide you with the requested service.
When you choose 'Embed Code' in the extension popup and click 'Paste', the extension makes the same request as
Wix does in order to wrap the embedded code in the Embed component. If you add an Embed component, open its settings, and
enter the code that will be embedded there, Wix makes exactly the same request.

### Code Execution

Usually, when a user installs an extension in Chrome, this extension runs some script on each opened page, no matter 
if you need it or not.
We work differently. We designed our extension in a way that it doesn't run any code on any page until
you open the extension popup. Before you open it, you can clearly see that this extension doesn't access your
page: Chrome will say that this extension will access your page only after you click on it.
